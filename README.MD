# Lesson: Organizing and Analyzing Data with NumPy and Pandas

Welcome! This lesson is for beginner AI engineering students who want to learn the most essential tools for handling data in Python. We will explore two powerful libraries:

* **NumPy**: The fundamental package for numerical computing in Python. It's the building block for almost all data science work.
* **Pandas**: The ultimate tool for cleaning, manipulating, and analyzing structured data. If you're working with data, you'll be using Pandas.

This guide and the accompanying files will walk you through the basics in a simple, step-by-step manner.

## What You Will Learn

* **NumPy Fundamentals**: How to create and work with powerful n-dimensional arrays (`ndarray`).
* **Essential Operations**: How to perform mathematical calculations and filter data efficiently without writing slow loops.
* **Intro to Pandas**: How to use Series and DataFrames, the core data structures for real-world analysis.
* **Data Handling**: How to load data from files (like CSVs), inspect it, and prepare it for analysis.
* **Data Cleaning**: How to find and handle common problems like missing values.
* **Basic Data Analysis**: How to ask questions about your data and get answers using tools like `groupby()`.

## What You Will Achieve

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to take a raw dataset, clean it up, and perform a meaningful analysis. For example, you'll be able to take student data, find the average score for different subjects, and identify the top-performing students, just like in the `what_we_will_achieve.py` example.

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

Before you begin, you need to install the necessary libraries.

1.  **Make sure you have a `requirements.txt` file** in your project folder with the following content:
    ```text
    pandas
    numpy
    ```
2.  **Open your terminal** and activate your virtual environment (e.g., `.venv`).
3.  **Run the following command** to install the libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

That's it! You're ready to start.

## 📂 Lesson Files

This project contains several files to guide you. It is recommended to go through them in the order listed below.

1.  **`sample_student_data.csv`**
    * A simple CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file containing sample data about students. We will use this as our dataset for analysis.

2.  **`what_we_will_achieve.py`**
    * **Purpose**: A "spoiler" script to show you at the *start* of the lesson. It demonstrates the final outcome of what you'll learn: loading, cleaning, and analyzing data to answer questions.

3.  **`1_intro_to_numpy.py`**
    * **Purpose**: Your starting point. This file introduces the basics of NumPy, from creating arrays to performing simple mathematical operations. Each concept is explained with comments.

4.  **`2_intro_to_pandas.py`**
    * **Purpose**: The next step in your journey. This file teaches you how to load data into a Pandas DataFrame, inspect it, select specific parts, and handle missing values.

5.  **`3_practical_application.py`**
    * **Purpose**: The final practical exercise. This script ties everything together. You will use both NumPy and Pandas to load the sample data, clean it, and perform a `groupby` analysis to find meaningful insights.

## How to Use These Files

For the best learning experience, follow these steps:

1.  **Run the "Goal" Script**: First, run `what_we_will_achieve.py` in your terminal to see the powerful end result.

# Technical Explanation of Lesson Files

## `what_we_will_achieve.py`

This script serves as a high-level preview to demonstrate the power of Pandas and NumPy working together. It shows the end goal of the lesson: performing a quick but meaningful data analysis.

**Technical Steps:**

1.  **Import Libraries**: Imports `pandas` as `pd` and `numpy` as `np`. `np.nan` is used to represent a missing data point.
2.  **Data Creation**: A standard Python dictionary is created. This dictionary is then used to instantiate a Pandas `DataFrame`, which is a 2D table-like data structure.
3.  **Data Cleaning**:
    * The script first calculates the mean (average) of the 'Score' column using `df['Score'].mean()`. This ignores the missing value in its calculation.
    * It then uses the `.fillna()` method to replace any missing values (`NaN`) in the 'Score' column with the calculated mean. `inplace=True` modifies the DataFrame directly without needing to reassign it.
4.  **Data Aggregation**:
    * The `.groupby('Subject')` method is called on the DataFrame. This powerful function groups all rows with the same value in the 'Subject' column.
    * Following the `groupby()`, `['Score'].mean()` is chained to it. This calculates the mean of the 'Score' for each group (i.e., each subject).
5.  **Filtering and Selection**:
    * The script demonstrates how to filter the DataFrame to find the top student in 'Math'.
    * First, it creates a new DataFrame containing only the rows where the 'Subject' is 'Math' using boolean indexing: `df[df['Subject'] == 'Math']`.
    * Then, it uses `.loc[]` combined with `.idxmax()` on the 'Score' column to find the index of the row with the highest score within that filtered group. This efficiently identifies the top student.

## `1_intro_to_numpy.py`

This script introduces the fundamental object in NumPy: the `ndarray`. It covers its creation, attributes, and the core concept of vectorized operations.

**Technical Steps:**

1.  **Array Creation**:
    * `np.array()`: Converts a standard Python list into a NumPy `ndarray`.
    * `np.zeros()` / `np.ones()`: Creates arrays of a specified shape (e.g., `(2, 3)` for 2 rows, 3 columns) filled entirely with `0`s or `1`s. This is useful for initialization.
    * `np.arange()`: Creates an array with a sequence of numbers, similar to Python's built-in `range()` but returns a NumPy array.
2.  **Array Attributes**:
    * `.shape`: An attribute (not a method) that returns a tuple representing the dimensions of the array.
    * `.ndim`: Returns the number of dimensions of the array (e.g., 1 for a vector, 2 for a matrix).
    * `.dtype`: Returns the data type of the elements within the array (e.g., `int64`, `float64`).
3.  **Indexing and Filtering**:
    * **Slicing**: Accessing elements uses the same bracket notation `[]` as Python lists.
    * **Boolean Indexing**: A key feature where you pass a conditional expression inside the brackets (e.g., `numbers[numbers > 15]`). NumPy evaluates the condition for each element and returns a new array containing only the elements that satisfy the condition.
4.  **Vectorized Operations**:
    * This demonstrates element-wise calculations. When you add two NumPy arrays of the same shape, NumPy adds the elements at each corresponding position without the need for a Python `for` loop. This is significantly faster as the operations are executed in compiled C code.
5.  **Aggregations**:
    * Functions like `np.sum()`, `np.mean()`, and `np.max()` are used to perform a single calculation over an entire array, quickly reducing it to a single summary value.

## `2_intro_to_pandas.py`

This script focuses on the core features of Pandas for data import, inspection, and manipulation. It introduces the `DataFrame` and shows how to perform fundamental data handling tasks.

**Technical Steps:**

1.  **Data Structures**: It first shows how to create a `DataFrame` from a Python dictionary, illustrating that a `DataFrame` is essentially a collection of columns (which are Pandas `Series`).
2.  **Data Import**:
    * `pd.read_csv('filename.csv')`: This is the primary function for reading tabular data from a text file into a DataFrame. Pandas automatically infers data types and headers.
3.  **Data Inspection**:
    * `.head()` / `.tail()`: Methods that return the first or last `n` rows of the DataFrame, useful for a quick preview of the data.
    * `.info()`: A crucial method that provides a technical summary of the DataFrame, including the index type, columns, non-null counts for each column, and data types (`dtype`).
    * `.describe()`: Generates descriptive statistics for all numerical columns, including count, mean, standard deviation, min/max, and quartiles.
4.  **Data Selection**:
    * **Column Selection**: `df['ColumnName']` selects a single column, returning a `Series`. `df[['Col1', 'Col2']]` selects multiple columns, returning a new `DataFrame`.
    * **.iloc[]**: "Integer-location" based indexing. It is used to select rows and columns by their integer position (e.g., `df.iloc[2]` gets the 3rd row).
    * **.loc[]**: "Label" based indexing. It is used to select data by its index label and column name (e.g., `df.loc['S03', 'Score']`).
5.  **Data Cleaning**:
    * `.isnull().sum()`: A common chain of commands. `.isnull()` returns a DataFrame of boolean values (True for missing, False for not). `.sum()` then counts the `True` values in each column.
    * `.dropna()`: Returns a new DataFrame with rows containing any missing values removed.
    * `.fillna()`: Fills missing (`NaN`) values with a specified value.
    * `.astype()`: A method to cast a column to a specified data type (e.g., from `float64` to `int`).

## `3_practical_application.py`

This final script combines concepts from both libraries to perform a complete, albeit simple, data analysis workflow. It demonstrates a more practical approach to data cleaning and analysis.

**Technical Steps:**

1.  **Load Data**: The script begins by loading the CSV into a DataFrame, same as the previous lesson.
2.  **Practical Data Cleaning**:
    * Instead of filling missing values with a static number like `0`, this script demonstrates a more robust method.
    * It first calculates the `mean()` of the 'Score' column.
    * It then uses this dynamic, calculated mean as the value in `.fillna()`, which is a better statistical practice than using an arbitrary number.
3.  **Group By and Aggregate**:
    * This script expands on the `.groupby()` concept. It shows how to group by one column ('Subject') and then apply multiple aggregation functions to different columns simultaneously using the `.agg()` method.
    * `.agg()` takes a dictionary where keys are the column names to be aggregated, and values are the aggregation functions to apply (e.g., `'mean'`, `'sum'`).
4.  **Sorting and Answering Questions**:
    * After creating an aggregated DataFrame, the script uses `.sort_values(by='ColumnName')` to re-order the results.
    * This allows you to easily identify maximums or minimums. By accessing the `.index` of the sorted result, the script programmatically extracts the name of the category (in this case, the subject) that answers a specific analytical question.
