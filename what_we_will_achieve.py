# GOAL: To quickly analyze student data, find the average score for each subject,
# and identify the top-performing student in 'Math'.

# In this lesson, you will learn to work with data like this.
# This is a dictionary, a standard Python data structure.

# You will learn to create a DataFrame - a powerful, table-like structure.
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
